Historically, a village green was common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland">grassland</a> with a pond for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland">watering cattle</a> and other stock,[citation needed] often at the edge of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area">rural</a> settlement, used for gathering cattle to bring them later on to a common land for grazing.[citation needed] Later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood">planned greens</a> were built into the centres of villages.</p>
